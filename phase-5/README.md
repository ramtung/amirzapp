Having multiple target words in each level. After finding all the target words, the user receives the total number of letters in the target words and the found bonus words as the score. The target words are sorted according to their length and then alphabetically.

* [amirzapp-5.1.cpp](amirzapp-5.1.cpp) *incomplete* Trying to hold the 'found' status of each target word in a separate list, which is not a good idea
* [amirzapp-5.2.cpp](amirzapp-5.2.cpp) Defining a structure holding a target word and its found status.
* [amirzapp-5.3.cpp](amirzapp-5.3.cpp) Re-scrambling is possible through 'scramble!' command.
* [amirzapp-5.4.cpp](amirzapp-5.4.cpp) Using STL functions to make the code more concise

Learning Points:
* Deciding on data structures
* Using lambda expressions (in sort and find_if)
