For the first phase, a target word is hard-coded in the program, and the user must guess that word, given the letters of the word, scrambled automatically.

* [amirzapp-1.1.cpp](amirzapp-1.1.cpp) The basic version, just checking if the input word (converted into lower case) equals the target word
* [amirzapp-1.2.cpp](amirzapp-1.2.cpp) Also checks if the user has used extra characters

Learning Points:
* Getting familiar with terminal IO using `iostream`
* Getting familiar with `string` type, and indexing using `[]` and `string::length()`
* Generating random numbers
