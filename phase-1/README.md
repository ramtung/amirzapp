For the first phase, a target word is hard-coded in the program, and the user must guess that word, given the letters of the word, scrambled automatically.

* [amirzapp-1.1.cpp](amirzapp-1.1.cpp) The basic version, just checking if the input word equals the target word
* [amirzapp-1.2.cpp](amirzapp-1.2.cpp) Convert the input to lower case letters
* [amirzapp-1.3.cpp](amirzapp-1.3.cpp) Check if the user has used extra characters

Learning Points:
* Getting familiar with terminal IO using `iostream`
* Getting familiar with `string` type, and indexing using `[]` and `string::length()`
* Using `string::substr` (not in the examples)
* Generating random numbers
