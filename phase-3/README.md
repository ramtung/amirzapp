Amirzapp is now a multi-level game! After successfully solving a level, the user advances to the next level. 

In version 3.3, there are multiple target words per level. After findng all target words, the user advances to the next level and receives a score equal to the sum of the lengths of all target words and the bonus words found. The user may enter "scramble!" command to re-scramble the letters.

* [amirzapp-3.1.cpp](amirzapp-3.1.cpp) Five levels are hard-coded in the program.
* [amirzapp-3.2.cpp](amirzapp-3.2.cpp) The levels are read from a file.
* amirzap-3.3 will be available later. 

Learning Points:
* Organizing a program into functions
* Defining data structures
* Global variables downsides
* file and string streams
