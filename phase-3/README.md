The user may guess other words that can be made with the given letters, but only one of them make him win. Use linked list and set to store other words.

* [amirzapp-3.1.cpp](amirzapp-3.1.cpp) Using list
* [amirzapp-3.2.cpp](amirzapp-3.2.cpp) Using STL find()
* [amirzapp-3.3.cpp](amirzapp-3.3.cpp) Using set
* [amirzapp-3.4.cpp](amirzapp-3.4.cpp) Using set::count

Learning Points:
* Holding data in linked lists
* Iterating over linked lists (range-based, iterators, but not indexing)
* Using `find`: how the iterator interface promotes reusability
* Holding data in `set`. 
* Special method `count` (Each container may have its own special operations)
