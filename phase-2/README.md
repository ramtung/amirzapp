* [amirzapp-2.1.cpp](#) The basic version, using a vector to hold other possible words
* [amirzapp-2.2.cpp](#) Using range-based loops on the vector
* [amirzapp-2.3.cpp](#) Using iterators to iterate over the vector

Learning Points:
* Getting familiar with `vector`
* Using `[]` and `vector::size()` to access vector's elements
* Iterating using range-based loops
* Basic use of iterators
