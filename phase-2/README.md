The user may guess other words that can be made with the given letters, but only one of them make him win.

* [amirzapp-2.1.cpp](amirzapp-2.1.cpp) The basic version, using a vector to hold other possible words
* [amirzapp-2.2.cpp](amirzapp-2.2.cpp) Using range-based loops on the vector
* [amirzapp-2.3.cpp](amirzapp-2.3.cpp) Using iterators to iterate over the vector
* [amirzapp-2.4.cpp](amirzapp-2.4.cpp) Using list container to hold other possible words
* [amirzapp-2.5.cpp](amirzapp-2.5.cpp) Using STL find()
* [amirzapp-2.6.cpp](amirzapp-2.6.cpp) Using set container to hold other possible words

Learning Points:
* Getting familiar with `vector`
* Using `[]` and `vector::size()` to access vector's elements
* Iterating using range-based loops
* Basic use of iterators
* Holding data in linked lists
* Iterating over linked lists (range-based, iterators, but not indexing)
* Using `find`: how the iterator interface promotes reusability
* Holding data in `set`. 
* Special method `count` (Each container may have its own special operations)
